Help users navigate a series of pages like search results.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

## When to use this component

Use this component when you need to show a list of information, such as search results, across multiple pages.

You might do this when:
- showing the full list on a single page makes the page too long to load
- the results further down the list are not needed by most users

## When not to use this component

Only break up lists into pages if it improves the performance or usability of your service.

Do not use this component to link sections together as a multi-page article.
Instead, use links named after the title of each section. Also, [see the Step by Step navigation pattern](/patterns/step-by-step-navigation/).

Avoid using the 'infinite scroll' technique to automatically load content when the user approaches the bottom of the page. This causes problems for keyboard users.

## How it works

Add the pagination component after the main content of each page in the list of
results.

[View an example of the component in a standard GOV.UK page template](in-page/index.html).

Show the page number to the title of the page so the user can see it in browser tabs and bookmarks. For example 'Search results (page 1 of 4)'.

Do not show pagination if there's only one page of results.

Redirect users to the first page if they enter a URL with a page number that does not exist.

### Previous and next links

Previous and next links should be labelled 'Previous page' and 'Next page'.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

If horizontal space is limited you can visually hide the word 'page'.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "compact-links", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Do not show the previous page link on the first page — and do not show the next page link on the last page.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "first-page", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "last-page", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Showing large numbers of pages

Use ellipses (`...`) to skip over pages when needed.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "elipses", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Adjust the page numbers shown to fit the horizontal space available.

Be sure to:
- show the first, last and current page
- show at least one page immediately before and after the current page
- replace gaps of 2 or more pages with elipses (`...`)

For example:
- **1** 2 … 100
- 1 **2** 3 … 100
- 1 2 **3** 4 … 100
- 1 2 3 **4** 5 … 100
- 1 … 4 **5** 6 … 100
- 1 … 97 **98** 99 100
- 1 … 98 **99** 100
- 1 … 99 **100**

### Showing the total number of results

If users need to know the number of total results, such as to tell them how sucessful a search has been, you can add that information like this:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "results", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

You can change "results" to something else if it makes more sense.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "team-members", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Filtering and sorting lists

If the user filters or sorts the list, apply this to the whole list (not just the current page) and redirect them back to the first page of the new results.

Set the number of items per page and the sorting algorithm so that most users
find what they need on the first page.

## Research on this component

This component is based on similar ones developed and used sucessfully by the
Ministry of Justice and the Home Office, and on feedback in the Design System
backlog.
