Help users navigate long lists split across multiple pages.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

## When to use this component

Use this component when you need help users navigate a long list of things that
have been split across multiple pages.

For example because the full list would take too long to download on a single page,
or because the things further down the list are not needed by most users.


## When not to use this component

Don't use pagination for short lists. Try to set the number of items per page so
that  most users find what they need on the first page.

Don't use pagination to link together sections in an article. Instead, use links
named after the title of each section.

Avoid using 'infinite scroll' style pagination (where new content loads onto the page
as the user approaches the bottom), as it causes problems for keyboard users.


## How it works

Add the pagination component below the main content of each page in the list of results.

Don't show the pagination component if there's only one page of results.

If the URL of a specific page is no longer valid, redirect users to the first page.

Show the current page in bold, but not as a link.

On the first page, don't show the link to a previous page.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "first-page", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

On the last page, don't show the link to a next page.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "last-page", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

When there are 10 or more pages, truncate the list using ellipses.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "elipses", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Always provide links to the first and last pages, so users can easily see
how many pages there are, and jump back to the first page in one click.

Show the total number of results if it's helpful to users - for example,
because it indicates how successful their search has been, or how large the data set is.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "results", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

By default the items are called 'results', but this can be changed.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "team-members", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

If the user filters or sorts the list, apply this to the whole list, not just the current
page. Redirect the user back to the first page of the new results.

Include information about the page number in the title of the page, so people
bookmarking it know which one they are. For example 'Search results (page 1 of 4)'.


## Research on this component

This component is based on similar ones developed and used sucessfully by the Ministry of
Justice and the Home Office, and on feedback in the Design System backlog.
