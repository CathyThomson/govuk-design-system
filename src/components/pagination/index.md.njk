Help users navigate a series of pages like search results or guides.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

## When to use this component

Use this component when you need to present content, such as guidance or search results, across multiple pages.

You might do this when:
- showing all the content on a single page makes the page take too long to load
- users may benefit from bookmarking or linking to specific pages of the content
- most users will only need the content on the first pages

## When not to use this component

Only break up content into pages if it improves the performance or usability of your service.

Avoid using the 'infinite scroll' technique to automatically load content when the user approaches the bottom of the page. This causes problems for keyboard users.

## How it works

Add the pagination component after the content on each page that you have broken up.

[View an example of the component in a standard GOV.UK page template](in-page/index.html).

For pages that users will mostly need to navigate in sequence, only show the previous and next links. Stack them  vertically, like this:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "labels", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

You can use the link labels to provide additional context.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "labels-2", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

For pages where users might need to jump multiple pages forwards or backwards, add numbered page links, as well as the previous and next links, like this:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Show the page number in the title of the page so the user can see it in browser tabs and bookmarks. For example 'Search results (page 1 of 4)'.

Do not show pagination if there's only one page of content.

Redirect users to the first page if they enter a URL of a page that no longer exists.

### Previous and next links

Previous and next links are labelled 'Previous page' and 'Next page'. The word
'page' can be visually hidden to conserve horizontal space.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

You can provide custom text for previous and next links if you need to.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "custom-link-text", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Do not show the previous page link on the first page — and do not show the next page link on the last page.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "first-page", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "last-page", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Showing large numbers of pages

Use ellipses (`…`) to skip over pages when needed.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "ellipses", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Adjust the page numbers shown to fit the horizontal space available.

On smaller screens only the first, last, current, previous and next pages will be shown.

Be sure to:
- include the first, last and current page
- include at least one page immediately before and after the current page
- replace gaps of 2 or more pages with ellipses (`…`)

For example:
- **[1]** 2 … 100
- 1 **[2]** 3 … 100
- 1 2 **[3]** 4 … 100
- 1 2 3 **[4]** 5 … 100
- 1 … 4 **[5]** 6 … 100
- 1 … 97 **[98]** 99 100
- 1 … 98 **[99]** 100
- 1 … 99 **[100]**

### Showing the total number of results

If users need to know the number of total results, such as to tell them how successful a search has been, you can add that information like this:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "results", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

You can change 'results' to something else if it makes more sense.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "team-members", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Filtering and sorting lists

If the user filters or sorts the list, apply this to the whole list (not just the current page) and redirect them back to the first page of the new results.

Set the number of items per page and the sorting algorithm so that most users
find what they need on the first page.

## Research on this component

This component is based on similar ones developed and used successfully by the
Government Digital Service, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office,
and on feedback in the Design System backlog.
